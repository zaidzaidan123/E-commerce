# E-commerce website

live : https://e-commerce-v1fp.vercel.app/


## Features

the project is about buy products 

I use a cart to put the products we want to buy on it and we can manage the quantity  and delete it.

I use a log in /log out using the fire base authentication 
.
and we can see multiple pics for products and view them

there is a page to filter by price and by subject

use React router, hooks and context to build it.
